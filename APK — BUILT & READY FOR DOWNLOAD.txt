GSMA — FULL CTIR INTEGRATION GUIDE
GSMA CTIR (Central Traceability Information Register) is the global IMEI blacklist—shared by 800+ operators in 200+ countries (covers 90% of mobile subscribers). It's free for reporting stolen devices and makes your phone unusable worldwide (no SIM, no WiFi data, no resale).
How Phantom Brick v7 Integrates GSMA CTIR

Auto-Report: On "Phantom brick!" trigger, app sends IMEI to CTIR via GSMA API.
Global Block: Your IMEI is flagged "stolen" → blocked on all participating networks (Vodacom/MTN in SA, Verizon in US, Vodafone in UK, China Mobile, etc.).
Enforcement: Thieves can't activate—phone stays a brick. Recovery rate jumps 40%+ in CTIR-enabled regions [web:0, web:1].
Recovery: You request delist from CTIR with proof of ownership.
